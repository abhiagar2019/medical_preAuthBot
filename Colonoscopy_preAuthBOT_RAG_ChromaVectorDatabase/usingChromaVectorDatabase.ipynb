Decision on Requested Procedure with condition(s) in the guidelines used to arrive at the answer: According to the information provided and the guidelines document, the requested procedure – colonoscopy, flexible; diagnostic with CPT code 45378 – is indicated for colorectal cancer screening for patients who are 45 years or older and have not undergone a colonoscopy in the past 10 years or have a high-risk family history. James Freeman is 40 years old with a family history of colorectal cancer (father had it at age 68) and is currently symptomatic with occasional rectal bleeding and abdominal discomfort. These criteria suggest that the Requested Procedure should be allowed.\n",

      "8. Walkthrough:\n",
      "   - James meets the high-risk family history criteria due to his father's history of colorectal cancer.\n",
      "   - He is symptomatic with rectal bleeding and abdominal discomfort.\n",
      "   - Although he is not 45 years old, the high-risk factor and symptoms justify the need for diagnostic colonoscopy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "The Requested Procedure for a diagnostic colonoscopy should be approved for James Freeman due to his symptoms (occasional rectal bleeding and abdominal discomfort), high-risk family history, and current age, in adherence to the guidelines that determine eligibility for colorectal cancer screening.\n"
