      "   - The conservative treatment with antacids hasn’t been successful since the symptoms persisted and minimal relief was noted.\n",
      "   - The last colonoscopy was on 07/22/2020, and as of the date of the medical record (12/06/2023), the guidelines indicate a colonoscopy is recommended for average-risk individuals every 10 years. Michail Antonio's last colonoscopy was over 3 years ago, which is within that window; however, abnormal findings had been identified.\n",
      "   - Michail Antonio is 48 years old, which meets the age criteria for average risk individuals mentioned in the guidelines for colorectal cancer screening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the above chain of thoughts, since the conservative treatment with antacids has failed to improve the symptoms significantly and there were abnormal findings from the last colonoscopy, the requested procedure is reasonably indicated as a follow-up to the previous diagnostic findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "The requested procedure, a diagnostic colonoscopy (CPT 45378), should be approved. The patient has persistent symptoms unrelieved by conservative treatments, and there were abnormal findings in the last colonoscopy that warrant further investigation.\n"
